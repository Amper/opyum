opyum installation
================================================


Python ``setuptools`` package is required to install opyum.


Use the following command line to install opyum from sources directory (containing setup.py):

    easy_install .

or

    python setup.py install


Alternatively you can install an up-to-date version of opyum from PyPI:

    easy_install opyum


Note: `easy_install` is bundled with ``setuptools``.
